Question : How can my wisedom be visible?
Answer: In form of taleem.help app. This is the show case and the plateform.

Working on taleem-canvas Editor EventManager.

EventManager : this is a wrapper object that takes in 5 functions and map them to the 5 mouse callbacks of the Player object. this is how it catch each mouse event and get the "Hit Item" (which is an itemObject using which we can edit the selectedItem).

EventManager: should just be used for connection between Player and "EvenProcessor"  the "set of 5 mouse events and the triggers.
EvenProcessor : has 5 mouse event handlers and event-triggers

        Player =====> EventManager =====> EvenProcessor <---- (items)

There can be other types of "EvenProcessor" for example for apps, games, quiz etc. But the idea is the same to get mouse-events from Player process them in event-handlers and if required trigger events.

    - EvenProcessor : Each module will contain
        1:5 mouse event-handlers:
        2: Set of triggers (events raised by the EventProcessor)
    it is yet to be seen where will be the location of the trigger functions.

 "EventProcessorEditor" is the name given to the EventProcessor that i am making for editing the Player component. But the same principles will apply to other versions of EventProcessors
