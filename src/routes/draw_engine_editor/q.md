i have objects in this fomrat
 {
        uuid: "44455764hfghyjty6",
        type: 'background',  
        backgroundColor: '#9cc19c',
        cellHeight: 25,
        cellWidth: 25,
        backgroundImage: "black_mat",
        globalAlpha: 1,
        showGrid: false,
        gridLineWidth: 1,
        gridLineColor: '#685454'
      };

eachobject has a uuid field which is unique

write me a function "deleteByUUID(items ,uuid) 
this fn takes in an array of object (each with a uuid field) and then delete the item with uuid == uuid
