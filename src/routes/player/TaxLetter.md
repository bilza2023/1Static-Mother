Subject: Request for Tax Rate Reconsideration - Commercial Property at Plot #20 Rafi Commercial

Dear Sir/Madam,

I, Major (Retired) Bilal Tariq (CNIC: 17301-51293777), am writing to respectfully request a review and reconsideration of the tax assessment on my commercial property located at Plot #20 Rafi Commercial (5 Marla Plaza).

I would like to bring to your attention several important factors regarding my financial situation:

1. This commercial property represents my sole property ownership, purchased in 2013-14 for Rs. 35,00,000 using my army pension and shared with my 70-year-old widowed mother.

2. My only sources of income are:
   - Military pension (on which I am already paying applicable taxes)
   - Rental income from this property

The current rental income from the building is Rs. 1,20,000 per month, which after necessary expenditures yields a net income of approximately Rs. 75,000-80,000 monthly. However, the present tax rate imposed on this property has become unsustainable for my financial situation.

Of particular concern is that the cumulative tax amount over the past decade has exceeded the original purchase price of the property (Rs. 35,00,000), which I believe demonstrates the disproportionate nature of the current tax assessment.

Additionally, the current economic conditions, including escalating electricity and gas costs, have impacted our tenants' ability to maintain rental payments, further straining our financial capacity to meet the existing tax obligations.

I kindly request your office to:
1. Review the current tax assessment considering these circumstances
2. Consider implementing a more reasonable tax rate that aligns with the property's actual income generation and my capacity to pay

I remain committed to fulfilling my tax obligations and would appreciate your consideration in establishing a more sustainable tax structure that allows me to continue operating this business while meeting my civic responsibilities.

Thank you for your time and consideration of this matter.


Yours sincerely,
Major (Retired) Bilal Tariq
