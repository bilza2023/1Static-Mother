I am creating an educational application for children in pakistan.

The intention are very noble since i want to provide cheap and quality education to the children of pakistan at a fraction.

However I am concerned about the finanncial success and validity of the idea.

    The idea:
        - it is a website specially made for pakistani students with video lesson for each and every subject spcially for math and science subjects.
        - the lesson are animated (using canvas and slides) with voice/narration.
        - since the lessons are animation with sound thus are very light weight 5-10mb (for 5 minutes) where as video of this length will consume 70-80Mb

        - the lesson are specific to syllabus and desires of pakistani students.

-- let start with this ask questions talk about validity of the idea
