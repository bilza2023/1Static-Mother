# Flexible Canvas App Design: Dos and Don'ts

## Core Architectural Principles

### Abstraction Layers
1. **Item-Literal Layer**: Pure data representation
   - Minimal logic
   - Serializable
   - Represents raw shape information

2. **EditObject Layer**: Interaction and manipulation
   - Adds behavior to item-literals
   - Provides uniform interface for interactions
   - Handles complex transformations

3. **Rendering Layer**: Drawing and context management
   - Separates drawing logic from object logic
   - Allows multiple rendering strategies

### Dependency Management
- Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- Use interfaces and abstract classes
- Allow easy swapping of components

## Specific Design Recommendations


## Dos: Maximize Flexibility

### Structural Dos
1. Use TypeScript for strong typing
2. Create abstract base classes
3. Design with composition over inheritance
4. Use dependency injection
5. Implement plugin-style architecture
6. Create clear, minimal interfaces

### Behavioral Dos
1. Make methods small and focused
2. Allow easy extension of existing classes
3. Create configuration objects for complex initializations
4. Support multiple rendering contexts
5. Design for testability

## Don'ts: Avoid Rigidity

### Structural Don'ts
1. Avoid tight coupling between components
2. Don't create monolithic classes
3. Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies
4. Don't hardcode assumptions about shape types
5. Prevent circular dependencies

### Implementation Don'ts
1. Don't mix rendering and logic
2. Avoid direct canvas manipulation in object classes
3. Don't create large, complex constructors
4. Avoid global state management
5. Don't rely on concrete implementations

## Future-Proofing Strategies

### Extensibility Techniques
- Plugin system for new shape types
- Configuration-driven object creation
- Event-based interaction model
- Separation of concerns

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of rendering strategies
- Efficient hit-detection algorithms
- Minimal object creation overhead
- Caching transformation results
```

## Key Architectural Insights

### Mental Model
Think of your application as a set of interchangeable, loosely connected components. Each component should:
- Have a single, clear responsibility
- Be replaceable without disrupting other parts
- Communicate through well-defined interfaces

### Philosophical Approach
Embrace change as a constant. Your architecture should anticipate evolution, not resist it.

### Practical Implementation Steps
1. Start with minimal, clear interfaces
2. Create abstract base implementations
3. Use factories for object creation
4. Design pluggable rendering strategies
5. Implement event-driven interactions
6. Continuously refactor and simplify

## Extensibility Checkpoint Questions
- Can I add a new shape type without modifying existing code?
- Can I change rendering strategy easily?
- Are my components loosely coupled?
- Can I mock objects for testing?
