Question 1: Additional Guaranteed Variables

Lets dive deep into these variable that you gave be to be added as guaranteed variables provided by EditObject. let talk about each

1: Rotation: already have but not implemented yet
2 Color : i already have
3 Visibility : great idea will add it
4 Layer/Z-Index : How to add this ? explain this in more detail.

Question 2: After implementing the EditObject i assume i will have the ability of following features. Can you think of any more features / methods that EditObject can contain by virtuew of the available guaranteed variable and by virtue that it has x,y,widht,height
# Features of EditObject
    - isHit (by mouse)
    - collision detection between items.
    - items overlapp.
    - recommendations............................


Question 3: I do not have any fields in my items for rotation, zoom x-index etc. CAN I SAFELY POSTPONE THEM TO LATER STAGES AFTER I GET THE LIB BASICS CORRECT? iwant to add them as features.
