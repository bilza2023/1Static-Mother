Based on your code, I'll explain how EventModule works and how event handlers are passed from TaleemDrawEngine.

## EventModule Overview

EventModule is responsible for handling mouse events on a canvas element. It does the following:

1. It captures mouse events (click, dblclick, mousedown, mousemove, mouseup)
2. It determines which item was clicked/interacted with
3. It calls appropriate callbacks when events occur

## How Event Handlers Flow

The interaction between TaleemDrawEngine and EventModule follows this process:

1. **Initialization**: When TaleemDrawEngine is created, it initializes EventModule
2. **Event Registration**: TaleemDrawEngine provides a method `onMouse()` to register callbacks
3. **Item Management**: EventModule keeps track of items that can be interacted with
4. **Event Routing**: When an event occurs, EventModule determines which item was hit and calls the appropriate callback

## Step-by-Step Flow

1. TaleemDrawEngine.svelte creates a DrawEngine instance during `onMount`:
   ```javascript
   taleem_draw_engine = new DrawEngine(canvasElement, ctx);
   ```

2. DrawEngine's constructor creates an EventModule instance:
   ```javascript
   this.eventModule = new EventModule(this.canvas);
   ```

3. When items are drawn via `draw()` method:
   ```javascript
   draw(items = []) {
     const itemObjects = itemsToObjects(items);
     this.eventModule.updateItems(itemObjects);
     this.clear();
     this.drawItems(itemObjects);
   }
   ```
   It:
   - Converts items to itemObjects (which have methods like `isHit()` and `draw()`)
   - Updates EventModule with these itemObjects
   - Draws the items

4. EventModule keeps track of these itemObjects and uses them to determine hits:
   ```javascript
   updateItems(itemObjects) {
     this.itemObjects = itemObjects;
   }
   ```

5. When registering event handlers, TaleemDrawEngine proxies to EventModule:
   ```javascript
   onMouse(eventType, callback) {
     this.eventModule.on(eventType, callback);
   }
   ```

6. When a mouse event occurs, EventModule:
   - Calculates mouse position
   - Determines which item was hit using the `isHit()` method
   - Calls the registered callback with the hit item

## Key Concepts

1. **Event Delegation**: Events are captured at the canvas level and then delegated to specific items
2. **Item Objects**: Your code converts "items" to "itemObjects" which have methods like `isHit()` and `draw()`
3. **Update Cycle**: Every time items are drawn, the EventModule is updated with the current set of itemObjects
4. **Hit Testing**: The `isHit()` method on each itemObject determines if a mouse event occurred on that item

## Data Flow Summary

1. TaleemDrawEngine.svelte → DrawEngine → EventModule
2. Items → itemObjects → EventModule.itemObjects
3. Mouse Events → EventModule.handleEvent → Registered callbacks

This architecture decouples drawing from event handling while keeping them synchronized through the `updateItems()` method.
