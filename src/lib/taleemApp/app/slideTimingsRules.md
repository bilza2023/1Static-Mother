In your system, a slide’s startTime and endTime are not manually entered but calculated: the startTime of the first slide is always 0, and every slide’s endTime is determined by adding its period (duration) to its startTime. For canvas slides, this is straightforward. But for eqs slides, each item inside has its own startTime and endTime, independent of the slide — so the slide’s overall timing must be stretched to fully cover the timings of its slowest/longest-running item. In short, slides must expand or adjust their period based on the items they hold, ensuring that no item "overflows" outside the slide’s lifespan.
