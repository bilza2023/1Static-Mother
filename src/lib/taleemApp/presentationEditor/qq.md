I am creating a Presentation Player using javascript and sveltekit4 . This presentation player has 2 types of slides (canvas as eqs). 


Currently everything is working fine except minor issues which we need to iron out before launch.

The objective is to create a production ready product for commercial launch.

I need you to forensically check this and improve so that we can come out with a commercial product
