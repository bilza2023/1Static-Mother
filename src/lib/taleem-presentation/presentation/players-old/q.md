Here are all the files from my Player module of my sveltekit library. 

1: Create 2 Components rather than one.
Currently I am using 1 component Player which internally selects players based on sound or not but i need 2 seperate components to avoid conflicts/confusion.

    - Player.svelte : this is the noramlly used component which always uses sound
    -PlayerWithoutSound.svelte : this is the component which does not use sound.
2: keep everthing else the same if possible if not possible inform me before hand.

3: remove all tailwindcss and replace with CSS

ask questions before giving me PlayerWithoutSound.svelte and  Player.svelte
